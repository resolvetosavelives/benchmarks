// This is to handle the bar chart segment labels, which are rotated -45º for other browsers,
// to just display as rotated at 90º via the writing direction CSS directive.

// This is to fix the problem of the navbar, for smaller screen sizes when the toggler is displayed,
// and when the toggler is used to expand the menu, that the .container height does not expand along
// with its content, resulting in the navbar's menu content being cut off at the top and bottom on IE.
