# Handle the plans model and the worksheet.
#
# Plans are typically created from the GoalsController, but are displayed,
# edited, deleted, etc. from here. This is unusual for a REST app, but plans
# are not really created from a plan sheet itself, but from the concept of a
# set of Goals.
#
# Otherwise, updates, deletes, and shows work as expected.
#
# The Index operation (GET /plans/) displays the list of plans owned by the
# user, and populates dropdown menus for starting a new plan.
#
# An unauthenticated user may get to this stage. This user is still allowed to
# edit the draft plan they have created, and the plan will be associated with
# their browser session. They'll be prompted to log in when they try to save
# the draft plan. After login (even if an account creation is involved), the
# draft plan will be attached to their account.
