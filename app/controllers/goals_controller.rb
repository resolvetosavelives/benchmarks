# Handle the goals sheet.
#
# A GET (show) operation on the goals sheet will display the assessment, the
# scores for the assessment, and the initial goals.
#
# A POST (create) operation on the goals sheet will post the goals, but instead
# of creating an Assessment or a Goals model (there is no Goals model), with
# create a draft plan (the Plan model), and redirect to that newly created
# plan.
#
# This is a bit unusual for a REST app, but makes sense in this context where
# the assessments are all seeded into the database in advance, and goals are an
# ephemeral concept used to bridge the gap between an assessment and a plan,
# but not saved.
