      Case. 
    A person who has the particular disease, health disorder or condition that meets the case definitions for surveillance and outbreak investigation purposes. The definition of a case for surveillance and outbreak investigation purpose is not necessarily the same as the ordinary clinical definition (adapted from Last JM, Spasoff RA, Harris, editors.
