      Internationally recognized standards for syndromic surveillance are available for the following five syndromes: (i) severe acute respiratory syndrome, (ii) acute flaccid paralysis, (iii) acute haemorrhagic fever, (iv) acute watery diarrhoea with dehydration, and (v) acute jaundice syndrome. Three core syndromes are chosen depending on national disease control priorities. The surveillance system should include epidemiological data and laboratory findings, which should be analysed by trained epidemiologists.
