          %p.large
            Countries must assess their ability to prevent, detect and respond
            to epidemics using different approaches that provide unique
            insights into the country's risk, vulnerability and capacity
            profile for infectious disease threats.

          The Joint External Evaluation (JEE) is a voluntary and comprehensive process conducted every 3-5 years to evaluate country capacity across 19 technical areas.
      %h3 2. Characterize risks and vulnerability

        %li
          The Strategic Tool for Assessing Risks (STAR) assesses the likelihood and potential impact of public health risks to inform planning and prioritization of health emergency preparedness and disaster risk management activities.
        %li
          Vulnerability and Risk Assessment Mapping (VRAM) assesses health risks within a country to inform disaster risk reduction, emergency preparedness and response plans.
      %h3 3. Evaluate real-world performance

        %li
          After-Action Reviews (AARs) are qualitative evaluations of a response to a real event. For protracted events such as COVID-19, countries may use an Intra-Action Review (IAR) to inform response and preparedness planning going forward.
        %li
          Simulation Exercises (SimExs) are qualitative evaluations of simulated events to test the performance of the preparedness system in anticipation of a real event.
