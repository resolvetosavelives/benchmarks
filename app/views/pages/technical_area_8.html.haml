        Impact
      Implementation of a comprehensive, sustainable and legally embedded national oversight programme for biosafety and biosecurity, including the safe and secure use, storage, disposal and containment of pathogens found in laboratories and a minimal number of holdings across the country, and involving research, diagnostic and biotechnology facilities within all sectors.

          37      
      Strengthened, sustainable biological risk management best practices are in place using common educational materials. Safe and compliant transport of infectious substances is also considered according to national and international regulations.
