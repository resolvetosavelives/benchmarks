        Impact
      Functional animal health, environment and human health systems work individually and collaboratively through documented mechanisms and operational frameworks, using a multisectoral One Health approach and based on international standards, guidance and best practices, to minimize the transmission of zoonotic diseases to human populations.

        Monitoring and evaluation
      (1) Agreement by the animal health and public health sectors on a common list of zoonotic diseases/pathogens of greatest national public health concern. (2) Existence of functional capacities in the animal health and public health sectors and of collaboration, coordination and communication between them for preparedness, detection, assessment and response to zoonotic diseases.
