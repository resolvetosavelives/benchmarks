    18. Radiation emergencies
  
  %p
    States Parties should have surveillance and response capacity for radiological emergencies and nuclear incidents. This requires effective coordination among all sectors involved in radiation emergency preparedness and response.

        Actions to achieve this level:
      %ul
        %li 
          Identify key technical experts from relevant sectors to develop technical guidelines or SOPs for the management of radiation emergencies (including risk assessment, reporting, event confirmation, notification and investigation).
        %li 
          Develop training package(s) on these guidelines/SOPs for the management of radiation emergencies and train relevant staff at least at the national level.
        %li 
          Develop policies, protocols and strategies for national and international transport of radioactive materials, samples and waste management, and ensure logistic requirements for transportation.
        %li 
          Procure or ensure access to stockpile to support radiation emergency preparedness and response, and develop a distribution plan for the event of an emergency. 
        %li 
          Develop guidelines for management of radiological waste including that from the hospitals and medical services.
        %li 
          Establish a waste management site with the required capacity for monitoring it. 
        %li 
          Develop case management guidelines to manage cases of radiation emergencies (either as a stand-alone guideline or as part of the case management guidelines for all hazards (refer to Benchmark 14.3)). 
        %li 
          Identify health facilities that can manage patients in the event of a radiation emergency. 
        %li 
          Train relevant healthcare workers on these protocols and guidelines.
        %li 
          Develop a mechanism for systematic information exchange between competent radiological authorities and human health surveillance units about radiological events and potential risks.
