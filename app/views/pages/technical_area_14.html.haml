    14. Medical countermesures and personnel deployment
  
  %p
    National framework for transferring (sending and receiving) medical countermeasures, public health and medical personnel from unaffected regions (rapid response teams/national emergency medical teams), and international partners during public health emergencies; and procedures for case management of events due to IHR relevant hazards.

        Impact
      Countries will have the necessary legal and regulatory processes and logistical plans to allow for rapid national or cross-border deployment and receipt of public health and medical personnel during emergencies. Regional (international) collaboration will assist countries in overcoming the logistical and regulatory challenges to deployment of public health and medical personnel from one country to another.
      
      %p
      Country has developed case management procedures and implemented it during health emergencies due to IHR relevant hazards.

        Monitoring and evaluation
      (1) Evidence of at least one response to a public health emergency within the previous year that demonstrates that the country sent or received medical countermeasures and personnel according to written national or international protocols, or a formal exercise or simulation that demonstrates these measures. (2) Evidence of demonstrating application of case management procedures for events due to IHR-relevant hazards. (3) Evidence of a strong national response team/emergency medical team (EMT) structures, exercises, trainings, among others.

        What are medical countermeasures? 
      Medical countermeasures are products (drugs, biologics, drugs, devices) that may be used in the event of a potential public health emergency due to IHR hazards (like infectious, food safety related events, chemical events and radiation events). These can be used to prevent, detect and respond to events associated with above mentioned threats and diseases.

      EMTs consist of health professionals providing direct clinical care to populations affected by outbreaks, disasters and emergencies as a surge capacity to support the local health system. They could be civilian or military or nongovernmental teams and include both national and international personnel.
