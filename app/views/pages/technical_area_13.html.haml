        Impact
      Development and implementation of a memorandum of understanding or other similar framework outlining roles, responsibilities and best practices for sharing relevant information among appropriate human and animal health, law enforcement and defense personnel, and validation of the memorandum of understanding through periodic exercises and simulations. Countries have systems to conduct and support joint epidemiological and criminal investigations to identify and respond to suspected biological, chemical or radiological incidents of suspected deliberate origin in collaboration with individual Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) of States Parties, FAO, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), OIE, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the United Nations Secretary-General’s Mechanism for Investigation of Alleged Use of Chemical and Biological Weapons, WHO and other relevant regional and international organizations as appropriate.
