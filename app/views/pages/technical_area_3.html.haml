    A functional system in place for the national response to prevent and combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR) with a One Health approach, including:
    %ul
      %li
        Multisectoral work spanning human, animal, crops, food safety and environmental aspects – this comprises developing and implementing a national action plan to combat AMR, consistent with the global action plan on AMR.
      %li
        Surveillance capacity for AMR and antimicrobial use at the national level, following and using internationally agreed systems such as the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) and the OIE global database on use of antimicrobial agents in animals.
      %li
        Prevention of AMR in healthcare facilities, food production and the community, through infection prevention and control measures.
      %li
        Ensuring appropriate use of antimicrobials, including assuring quality of available medicines, conservation of existing treatments and access to appropriate antimicrobials when needed, while reducing inappropriate use.

        Impact
      Decisive and comprehensive action to prevent the emergence and reduce the spread of AMR. Countries will (in line with the global action plan) increase awareness of AMR risks and how to respond to them; strengthen surveillance and laboratory capacity; enhance infection prevention and control activities; ensure uninterrupted access to essential antimicrobials of assured quality; regulate and promote the appropriate use of antimicrobials in human medicine, veterinary medicine, food production and other fields as appropriate; and support initiatives to foster the development and appropriate use of new antimicrobial agents, vaccines and diagnostic tools.

        Monitoring and evaluation
      (1) Multisectoral national action plan to combat AMR has been produced and made public. (2) Implementation of the AMR national action plan/sector plans, with monitoring and yearly reporting on progress (including reporting to the international level) is in place. (The JEE tool reviews the country’s self-assessed response to the global monitoring survey on AMR.)
