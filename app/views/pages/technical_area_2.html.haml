    2. IHR coordination, communication and advocacy and reporting
  %p
    Each country requires a well-supported, adequately trained team of national focal point(s) (NFPs) for the IHR to ensure effective coordination, communication and partnerships to prevent, detect, assess and respond to any public health events. The country ensures sustainable functioning of the IHR NFPs for IHR communications, coordination and partnership.

        Impact
      A mechanism for multisectoral/multidisciplinary coordination, communication and partnerships to prevent, detect, assess and respond to any public health event or emergency is in place. An IHR NFP that is always accessible to communicate with the regional WHO IHR Contact Points and with all relevant sectors and other stakeholders in the country.

        Monitoring and evaluation
      (1) Establishment of a functional multisectoral and multidisciplinary mechanism for the coordination and integration of relevant sectors in the implementation of IHR and to respond to any public health events and emergencies. (2) Regular testing of the mechanism through actual experience and/or exercises and subsequent improvement of arrangements and procedures.
