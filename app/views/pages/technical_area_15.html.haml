    15. Risk communication
  
  %p
    Risk communication capacity at the national and subnational levels should ensure timely and effective two-way communication between concerned authorities and the population at risk. This includes both proactive dissemination of information and active listening. The exchange of information, advice and opinion should be done through channels and platforms that are accessed and most trusted by the at-risk population (such as the media, social media, mass awareness campaigns, health promotion, social mobilization, stakeholder or via trusted community leaders).

        Impact
      Effective risk communication allows people at risk to understand and adopt protective behaviours. It allows authorities and experts to listen to and address peopleâ€™s concerns and needs so that the advice they provide is relevant and trusted. Feedback from at-risk community members is used to tweak broader response measures, making them more likely to be accepted.

        Monitoring and evaluation
      (1) Formal government risk communications plans, arrangements and systems in place. (2) Existence of risk communication coordination mechanisms for internal and partner communication. (3) Evidence that the public communication unit or team operates efficiently and effectively. (4) Evidence that risk communication units systematically engage populations at the community level during emergencies. (5) Existence of a system to gather information on perceptions, risky behaviours and misinformation to analyse public concerns and fears.
