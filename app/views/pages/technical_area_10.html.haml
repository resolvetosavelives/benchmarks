    10. Human resources
  
  %p
    States Parties with competent and well-motivated health personnel for sustainable and functional public health surveillance and response are available at all levels of the health system for effective implementation of IHR. Human resources include nurses and midwives, physicians, epidemiologists and other public health and environmental specialists, social scientists, communications personnel, occupational health personnel, laboratory scientists/technicians, biostatisticians, information technology (IT) specialists and biomedical technicians. There is a corresponding workforce in the animal sector of veterinarians, animal health professionals, para-veterinarians, epidemiologists and IT specialists. 
  %p
    The recommended density of doctors, nurses and midwives per 1000 population for operational routine services is 4.45 plus 30% surge capacity. The optimal target for surveillance is one trained (field) epidemiologist (or equivalent) per 200 000 population who can systematically cooperate to meet relevant IHR and PVS core competencies. One trained epidemiologist is needed per rapid response team.
