    Strategic risk assessment identifies, analyses and evaluates the range of risks in a country and enables the risks to be assigned a level of priority. It includes analyses of potential hazards exposures and vulnerabilities, identification and mapping of available resources, and analyses of capacities (routine and surge) at the national, intermediate and local or primary levels to manage the risks of outbreaks and other emergencies. Emergency preparedness applies to any hazard that may cause an emergency and includes biological, chemical, radiological and nuclear, natural, other technological and societal hazards.

        Impact
      Multisectoral actors at national and subnational (local and intermediate) levels have a common understanding of the priority risks and are ready for timely, effective and efficient emergency response operations for outbreaks and other emergencies.

        Monitoring and evaluation
      (1) Existence of national strategic multihazard emergency risk assessments (risk profiles) and resource mapping. (2) Existence of multihazard emergency response plans. (3) Evidence from exercises as well as after-action and other reviews of effective and efficient multisectoral emergency response operations for outbreaks and other public health emergencies.

      “Emergency preparedness” (defined as, the knowledge, capacities and organizational systems developed by governments, response and recovery organizations, and communities and individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from the impacts of likely, imminent, emerging or current emergencies) is a combination of planning, allocation of resources, training, exercising, and organizing to build, sustain and improve operational capabilities at national, intermediate and local or primary response levels based on strategic risk assessments).
      %p
        Multisectoral actors at national and subnational (local and intermediate) levels have a common understanding of the priority risks and are ready for timely, effective and efficient emergency response operations for outbreaks and other emergencies. Risk based plans for emergency preparedness and response, robust emergency management structures and mobilization of resources during an emergency are critical for a timely response to public health emergencies.
