  %p
    Countries will: have a coordination mechanism, incident management systems, exercise management programmes and public health emergency operation centres (EOCs) functioning according to minimum common standards; and maintain trained, functioning, multisectoral rapid response teams and trained EOC staff capable of activating a coordinated emergency response within 120 minutes of the identification of an emergency.

        Impact
      Effective coordination and improved management of the response to outbreaks and emergencies as evidenced by shorter times from early warning and detection to activation and implementation of a coordinated multisectoral response across all levels resulting in fewer cases, deaths and other health and societal impacts.
