import { Controller } from "stimulus"
/* This controller handles all of the modal dialogue boxes involved with
 * assessment selection. The functions here support two different workflows
 * (and an evolving understanding of Stimulus).
 *
 * This is actually a multi-step modal with varying steps, more wizard-like
 * than a modal. Current state must be stored in the Next button so that it can
 * be submitted to this controller when the button is pressed. The button also
 * dictates which state the modal is going into.
 *
 * In that light, known states are null, "assessment-selection-modal" and
 * "from-technical-areas".
 *
 *   null -- no modal is currently open
 *
 *   assessment-selection-modal -- the assessment selection modal is open. This
 *   could be either the version that already knows the country and shows only
 *   the list of possible assessments (_assessment_selection_modal.html.erb),
 *   or the version that shows both the country list and the assessment list
 *   (_joint_assessment_selection_modal.html.erb).
 *
 *   from-technical-areas -- the modal for selecting the capacities for an
 *   assessment is open (_technical_area_selection_modal.html.erb).
 *
 *   If the current state is `assessment-selection-modal` and the
 *   `assessmentTypeSelect` value is `from-technical-areas`, the transition to the
 *   capacities dialogue will be honored. `assessmentTypeSelect` is anything
 *   else, it will be assumed to be an actual assessment type, and the entire
 *   form will be submitted, instead.
 *
 * The "next" button in a dialog needs to provide both the current state
 * (`data-current` and the next state `data-next`).
 *
 * Targets that provide data to the page:
 *   getStartedButton -- the green "Get Started" button that appears on the
 *   landing page. The controller toggles the button's enabled/disabled status.
 *
 *   countryNameLabel -- this also carries the country name, solely for
 *   populating the country name in the dialogue copy.
 *
 *   submitForm -- this is the button that either submits the form or
 *   transitions to the next step of the dialog. The controller toggles the
 *   button's enabled/disabled status.
 *
 *   countryName -- this carries the country name for populating into hidden
 *   fields.
 *
 * Targets that provide page data to the controller:
 *
 *   selectables -- contains a JSON-encoded dictionary of all of the countries
 *   and their associated assessments. The server populates this in the page
 *   when it renders the page.
 *
 *   form -- the entire form itself. This must contain all of the fields to be
 *   submitted, including hidden fields. The form generally does not get
 *   submitted from the web page any more, but instead from the next function
 *   of this controller.
 *
 * Targets that can do both:
 *   countrySelect -- the country selection dropdown. The controller can use
 *   this to change the currently selected country (but does not do so at this
 *   time), and to read the currently selected country. This helps the
 *   controller determine whether the form is valid, and what assessment types
 *   need to be populated.
 *
 *   assessmentTypeSelect -- this is the assessment types dropdown, and this
 *   controller clears and repopulates it whenever the country selection
 *   changes. The controller also reads it when determining whether the entire
 *   form is valid.
