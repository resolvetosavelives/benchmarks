We propose that the timeliness of outbreak detection, reporting, laboratory confirmation, response, and public communication should be considered as measures for improving global health security at the national level, allowing countries to track progress over time and inform investments in disease surveillance.","author":"M Smolinski, W Crawley, J Olsen ","date":"2017","relevant_pages":"All","thumbnail_url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f16cdd4d8d936987f466cccb080b6262/4d7da72b","reference_type":"Best Practice","created_at":"2022-10-26 19:37:39 UTC","updated_at":"2022-10-26 19:37:39 UTC","last_modified":"2021-07-12 17:41:11 UTC","url":null,"technical_areas":["Surveillance"],"airtable_id":"rech4HuSxNZShasi7","benchmark_indicator_action_ids":[405,413,416]},{"id":160,"title":"Africa CDC Framework for Event-based Surveillance","description":"This guidance document is intended to serve as an outline that can guide stakeholders interested in implementing event-based surveillance.","author":"Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention","date":"2018","relevant_pages":"All, Module 5, Module 2.2","thumbnail_url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/16f033c953cfe01aa396684b935d6182/7a14b4f5","reference_type":"Guideline","created_at":"2022-10-26 19:37:39 UTC","updated_at":"2022-10-26 19:37:39 UTC","last_modified":"2021-07-12 17:41:21 UTC","url":null,"technical_areas":["Surveillance"],"airtable_id":"recBbkbHXtw90vXax","benchmark_indicator_action_ids":[423,416,417]},{"id":161,"title":"Disaster Financial Management Guide Guidance for State, Local, Tribal & Territorial Partners","description":"Provides guidance for U.S. jurisdictions (e.g., state, local, tribal and territorial governments) establish and implement sound disaster financial management practices.","author":"FEMA - USA","date":"2020","relevant_pages":"All","thumbnail_url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6ef83e8e777fc96a3e3e9a4d939382ac/e6e55f33","reference_type":"Guideline","created_at":"2022-10-26 19:37:39 UTC","updated_at":"2022-10-26 19:37:39 UTC","last_modified":"2021-07-12 17:43:02 UTC","url":null,"technical_areas":["National Legislation, Policy and Financing"],"airtable_id":"recM5nM4Km1V7ca0s","benchmark_indicator_action_ids":[30,35]},{"id":162,"title":"Disaster Simulation Exercises: a how to guide for the Pacific- Government of New Zealand (2014)","description":"This guide has been written to accompany the DVD and assist viewers in working through the five steps of the exercise cycle.
