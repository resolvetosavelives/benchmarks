A series of annexes was developed to help guide countries through adjusting various public health measures in different contexts. This annex shows a pragmatic decision process for adapting PHSM based on epidemiological and public health criteria, and it should be read in conjunction with the interim guidance document. 1 The document presents only public health criteria, while other critical factors, such as economic factors, security-related factors, human rights, food security, and public sentiment, should also be considered. This document is intended for national authorities and decision makers in countries that have introduced large scale PHSM and are considering adjusting them.","author":"World Health Organization","date":"April 16, 2020","relevant_pages":"All","download_url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/60ca2c34f356530fbb5fade892a14611/791f88cf/WHO-2019-nCoV-Adjusting_PH_measures-2020_2-eng.pdf","thumbnail_url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/794b9a2ab9ec9ed8d21f48bfa492c69b/c2c71477","technical_area":"Emergency Response Operations","reference_type":"Guidelines","created_at":"2021-08-18 17:33:54 UTC","updated_at":"2021-08-18 17:33:54 UTC","last_modified":"2021-04-12 19:52:14 UTC","url":null,"benchmark_indicator_action_ids":[610]},{"id":91,"title":"Considerations for mass gatherings in the context of COVID-19","description":"The purpose of this annex is to provide key considerations to health authorities and event organizers for reopening mass gatherings (MG); it should be read in conjunction with the interim guidance.","author":"World Health Organization","date":"2020","relevant_pages":"All","download_url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/bf28a04c10830fce0c67418af4c35485/7887a192/WHO-2019-nCoV-Adjusting_PH_measures-Mass_gatherings-2020_1-eng.pdf","thumbnail_url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/78fbf705ce4e869ee31b721e8f512030/26c0b95b","technical_area":"Emergency Response Operations","reference_type":"Guidelines","created_at":"2021-08-18 17:33:54 UTC","updated_at":"2021-08-18 17:33:54 UTC","last_modified":"2021-04-12 19:52:21 UTC","url":null,"benchmark_indicator_action_ids":[610]},{"id":92,"title":"WHO One Health online course (90min)","description":"This course is free and geared to professionals from human, animal or environmental health sectors involved in the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005).\n\nObjectives are to (i) Describe the One Health approach and principles of multisectoral collaboration; (ii) Provide examples of how a One Health approach may be taken to address a health threat or disease event; and (iii) Explain how a One Health approach contributes to a functional national health system, including national IHR implementation, evaluation, and capacity building.","author":"World Health Organization","date":"NA","relevant_pages":"All","download_url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/889e240fab3e76549300bc70e7a9bb86/03c61d84/WHOlearningportal.docx","thumbnail_url":null,"technical_area":"IHR Coordination, Communication and Advocacy, and Reporting,Zoonotic Disease","reference_type":"Training Packages","created_at":"2021-08-18 17:33:54 UTC","updated_at":"2021-08-18 17:33:54 UTC","last_modified":"2021-04-12 19:53:22 UTC","url":"https://extranet.who.int/hslp/training/login/index.php","benchmark_indicator_action_ids":[73,194,182,179]},{"id":93,"title":"ECDC Handbook on simulation exercises in EU Public health settings","description":"The purpose of this simulation exercise handbook is to support organisations in the public health sector in strengthening their response to events involving communicable diseases, based on effective simulation exercises as a part of preparedness.
